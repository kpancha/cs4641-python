# cs4641-python

This repository contains Python implementations for various machine learning techniques, all of which I coded from scratch as a part of the course CS 4641 (Machine Learning) at Georgia Tech. Read more about each of the models below:

### K-Means clustering
K-Means initializes _k_ random cluster centers and catetgorizes each datapoint into whichever of the _k_ clusters it is closest to. In this implementation, I used pairwise Euclidean distance for clustering and sum of squared errors for calculating losses.

### Gausian Mixture Model
A GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes all the datapoints can be produced from a combination of a finite amount of Gaussian distributions. It is a soft clustering algorithm that groups each datapoint to a cluster and assigns it a probability of being in that cluster. The implementation uses expectation maximization to fit the model and maximum likelihood estimation to optimize the parameters.
